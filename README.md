# Pet Play dates
Pet Owners can setup play dates for their pets

First We created a database using PHPMyAdmin. The database is called petdates. In the petdates database, we have a table called users which contain the following:

id - int(11) auto increment
firstname varchar(100)
lastname varchar(100)
phone(10)
username  -  varchar(100)
email  -  varchar(100)
password  -  varchar(100)
